# Inverted and Positional Index

## Description
While it’s amazing to use the search engine to fulfill your information need, it’s equally important for you to learn the mechanics behind it to obtain accurate results.The Boolean model is based on Boolean logic and set theory operations.The user query is transformed into a boolean expression , written either in conjunctive normal form or disjunctive normal form.Positional and Inverted indexing are different implementations of Boolean Model to resolve boolean queries.These indexing methods produce rankless documents but provides basis to models like Bi-Word indexes , Wild-card queries.

## About The Project
This project is based on the implementation of various Boolean Models - Inverted Index and Positional Index in python.Furthermore , to visualize the models , its UI is developed on FLASK.

#Steps to Execute the FLASK UI

In the Positional and Inverted Index files : 
1) Enter the Abstract folder path which contain all the files.
2) Enter the path for StopWords.txt file.

--If successful , Positional and Inverted indexes will be  made

To show the Indexes and Document on Flask UI:

1)Create a virtual env
2)Activate the venv by : source .env/bin/activate
3)export FLASK_ENVIRONMENT=development
4)export FLASK_APP=app2.py
5)FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run
